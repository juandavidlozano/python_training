# Module 1: Introduction to Apache Spark and PySpark

This module provides a comprehensive introduction to Apache Spark, the Spark ecosystem, and setting up a PySpark environment. You will understand key concepts, install and configure PySpark, and explore Spark's monitoring interface.

## 1.1 Overview of Big Data and Spark Ecosystem

### History of Spark and Comparison to Hadoop MapReduce
Apache Spark was developed at UC Berkeley’s AMPLab in 2009 as an alternative to Hadoop’s MapReduce due to the demand for faster, more flexible data processing. Spark is known for its speed and ease of use, especially for large-scale data processing, thanks to its in-memory computing capabilities.

**Why Spark over MapReduce?**
- **Speed**: Spark performs tasks up to 100x faster than MapReduce by processing data in-memory.
- **Ease of Use**: It offers higher-level APIs in Java, Python, Scala, and R.
- **Flexibility**: Spark supports various workloads, including batch processing, interactive queries, real-time analytics, machine learning, and graph processing.

### Key Components of the Spark Ecosystem

1. **Spark Core**: The engine for data processing that handles scheduling, memory management, and fault recovery.
2. **Spark SQL**: Enables querying structured data using SQL and the DataFrame API.
3. **Spark Streaming**: Real-time data processing with micro-batches.
4. **MLlib**: Spark’s scalable machine learning library.
5. **GraphX**: A library for graph computation.

**Example Use Cases**:
- **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**: Using Spark to transform and prepare data.
- **Real-Time Analytics**: Using Spark Streaming to process live data from IoT devices.
- **Machine Learning**: Training machine learning models on large datasets with MLlib.

## 1.2 Setting Up PySpark Environment

In this section, you'll set up PySpark locally and on the cloud, configure it in Jupyter and VS Code, and understand how to monitor Spark jobs using Spark UI.

### Installing PySpark Locally

To install PySpark, use `pip` in your terminal:

```bash
pip install pyspark
```

#### Verifying PySpark Installation

Once installed, verify it by launching the PySpark shell. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pyspark
```

**Expected Output**:
You should see the Spark shell interface, with a welcome message that includes information about the Spark version.

#### Quick PySpark Example

Try a basic PySpark example to confirm the setup. In the PySpark shell, run:

```python
data = [("Alice", 34), ("Bob", 45), ("Catherine", 29)]
df = spark.createDataFrame(data, ["Name", "Age"])
df.show()
```

**Expected Output**:
```plaintext
+----------+---+
|      Name|Age|
+----------+---+
|     Alice| 34|
|       Bob| 45|
|Catherine | 29|
+----------+---+
```

### Installing PySpark in Jupyter Notebook

PySpark integrates with Jupyter for interactive data analysis. To use PySpark in Jupyter:

1. **Install Jupyter** if you haven’t already:

   ```bash
   pip install jupyter
   ```

2. **Configure PySpark with Jupyter**:

   Open a new notebook, and in the first cell, configure PySpark by setting up environment variables:

   ```python
   import os
   os.environ['SPARK_HOME'] = "/path/to/spark"
   os.environ['PYSPARK_PYTHON'] = "/usr/bin/python3"

   import findspark
   findspark.init()
   ```

3. **Initialize SparkSession**:

   In the next cell, create a `SparkSession`, which is the entry point to Spark programming with the DataFrame API.

   ```python
   from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
   spark = SparkSession.builder.master("local").appName("MyApp").getOrCreate()
   ```

4. **Verify with a Sample DataFrame**:

   ```python
   data = [("Alice", 30), ("Bob", 28)]
   df = spark.createDataFrame(data, ["Name", "Age"])
   df.show()
   ```

### Setting Up PySpark in Visual Studio Code

1. **Install PySpark Extension**:
   Install the "PySpark" extension in VS Code from the Extensions panel.

2. **Configure VS Code to Use PySpark**:
   In your VS Code settings, set up the Python interpreter path and ensure that PySpark is accessible.

3. **Run a PySpark Script**:
   Create a new Python file (`example.py`) and add the following code:

   ```python
   from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
   spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("VSCodeTest").getOrCreate()

   data = [("Alice", 24), ("Bob", 27)]
   df = spark.createDataFrame(data, ["Name", "Age"])
   df.show()
   ```

   Run the script with `python example.py` to verify it works.

### Introduction to Spark UI

Spark provides a web-based interface, **Spark UI**, which is essential for monitoring and debugging applications.

#### Accessing the Spark UI

When Spark is running (e.g., through `pyspark` shell or a running job), Spark UI can be accessed at `http://localhost:4040`.

#### Key Sections of the Spark UI

1. **Jobs**: Shows all Spark jobs, their execution status, and timing.
   - **Example**: Run the following code in PySpark to trigger a job:
     ```python
     rdd = spark.sparkContext.parallelize([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
     rdd.reduce(lambda x, y: x + y)
     ```
   - Check the **Jobs** tab to see the job created by the `reduce` operation.

2. **Stages**: Each job consists of multiple stages that are displayed here. You can inspect each stage for memory usage and execution time.

3. **Storage**: Shows information about cached RDDs and DataFrames, including memory and disk usage.

4. **Environment**: Lists all environment variables, JVM settings, and Spark properties, useful for debugging and configuration.

5. **Executors**: Shows active executors, their memory usage, and CPU utilization. Helps monitor resource allocation for better performance.
